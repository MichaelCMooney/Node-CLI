# Node-CLI
A sample of an interactive Node CLI using Inquirer that I built.

## Dependencies
1) NodeJS
2) npm

Once you have those, you will need to run:
1) npm install -g . 
<br>This will make the CLI global on the system so it can be accessed from anywhere.
2) npm install inquirer
<br>This will enable the Inquirer package to make the CLI have interactive interfaces.
3) npm install shelljs
<br>This allows us to add in-depth logic to the application.
