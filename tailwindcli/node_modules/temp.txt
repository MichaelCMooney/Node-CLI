Since I've seen this code copied onto other people's GitHub's without credit and used in guides online, I added a small little anti-spoof hidden inside here!
Not to worry! I don't have any licensing on this CLI and don't care if people use it. I just hate to see people steal it and use it in guides and such online without giving any credit.
Please give me credit where you can. :)
